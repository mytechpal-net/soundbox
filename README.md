## What is it ?

For the oldest, there was a time with a chat messaging application "MSN messenger". It was a 1-1 conversation, with an incredible feature : the wizz. 
Typically this button made a weird noize to catch the attention of the other one.  

The idea is to bring this concept back, but with multiple sounds, and multiple people. The interface allow to create a small group of people and upload sounds.  
Then everyone is able to play a sound to everyone.  Like a ping, but with mp3.  

## Disclaimer

Do not use sounds that you don't own.
